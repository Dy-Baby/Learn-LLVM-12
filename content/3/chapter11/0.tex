LLVM comes with a set of tools that helps you to identify certain errors in your application. All of these tools make use of the LLVM and Clang libraries.\par

In this chapter, you will learn how to instrument an application with sanitizers, how to use the most common sanitizer to identify a wide range of bugs, and how to implement fuzz testing for your application. This will help you to identify bugs that are usually not found with unit testing. You will also learn how to identify performance bottlenecks in your application, running the static analyzer to identify problems normally not found by the compiler, and creating your own Clang-based tool with which you can extend Clang with new functionality.\par

This chapter will cover the following topics:\par

\begin{itemize}
\item Instrumenting an application with sanitizers
\item Finding bugs with libFuzzer
\item Performance profiling with XRay
\item Checking the source with the Clang Static Analyzer
\item Creating your own Clang-based tool
\end{itemize}

By the end of the chapter, you will know how to use various LLVM and Clang tools to identify a large category of errors in an application. You will also acquire the knowledge to extend Clang with new functionality, for example, to enforce a naming convention or to add new source analysis.\par
