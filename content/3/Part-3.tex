In this section, you will learn how instruction selection is implemented in LLVM, and you will apply this knowledge by adding support for a new machine instruction. LLVM has a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, and you will learn how you can use it and how to tailor it to your needs. You will also try out the various tools and libraries that help to identify bugs in applications. Finally, you will extend LLVM with a new backend, which will equip you with the knowledge required to take advantange of new architectures not yet supported by LLVM. \par

	\item Chapter 9, Instruction Selection
	\item Chapter 10, JIT Compilation
	\item Chapter 11, Debugging Using LLVM Tools
	\item Chapter 12, Creating Your Own Backend
